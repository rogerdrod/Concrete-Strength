# Concrete-Strength
This project was a final project I did for Computational thinking with the help of 3 other team members. Our project was to use the given concrete strength data and figure out what kind of regression we would need to use to make the best predictor of conctrete strength given a certain set of input. We then had to add the data to the original Excel file to update the data and make the predictions even better. I contributed to this project by creating the whole jupyter notebook and adding the the commentary on the steps we took to solve the problem. I coordinated weekly discord calls so that we could talk about how the project is going and to assign other tasks.
